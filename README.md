# musje
A numbered musical notation in sheet music.

## Background
Musje is sparrow in Dutch. The first numbered musical notation was
presented by Jean-Jacques Rousseau to the French Academy of
Sciences in 1742. It has been evolved and become popular in some
areas of Asia, and called jianpu in Chinese. The musje 123 is a
music processor based on this notation.

## Development
This project was initiated about year 2015. Due to several reasons
from the author, several attempts has been missed or discontinued.
However, the experiences are not wasted. This current
implementation is called musje 2 (codename: gezondheid).
